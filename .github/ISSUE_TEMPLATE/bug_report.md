## Steps to reproduce

Describe the clear steps to reproduce the issue.

## Observed result

What's the observed result?

## Expected result

What's the expected result?

## Demo link

The link to the demo illustrating the supposedly incorrect behavior.

If a phone number is "valid" in your app and "invalid" on the demo page then it means that your app uses non-`max` metadata (see the readme for more info on `min` vs `max`).

## Google's demo link

If it's a validation/parsing/formatting/AsYouType bug, then post a link to Google's `libphonenumber` demo page illustrating the correct behavior.

If Google's demo page behavior is the same as this library's demo page behavior, then submit an issue in Google's repo instead (see "Bug reporting" section of this library's readme).
